        Another terrific session of play comes to an end. A shared session for both teams but Australia still in on top in this contest. 57 runs scored in 26 overs in the morning session on Day four as Alex Carey and Mitchell Starc go into the break unbeaten on 41 and 11 respectively. Australia lost two wickets in the session in form of Marnus Labuschagne (41) and Cameron Green (25) but have got to 201 for six in their second innings which means they now LEAD India by 374 RUNS. Umesh Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja were the two wicket takers for India in the session. That's it! Stumps on Day 4. Nathan Lyon completes the final over of the Day. A solid fight from the India batters in the final session as they end the day at 164 for three in chase of a record 444 against Australia. After losing Shubman Gill at the stroke of Tea, Rohit Sharma (43) and Cheteshwar Pujara (27) added a solid 51-run partnership but then Australia hit back, removing both the set batters in successive overs. Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane then steadied the chase, stitching a 71-run unbeaten.<!--Paragraph-->  <!-- Anchor tag -->
